# Remote Coding Agent

This project provides a collection of containerized AI agents designed to automate coding tasks on remote Git repositories. Each agent is specialized for a different AI model (e.g., Claude, Gemini) and can be run independently.

## Project Structure

-   `/agents`: Contains the subdirectories for each individual AI agent.
    -   `/agents/claude`: A containerized agent that uses Anthropic's Claude model to perform coding tasks.
    -   `/agents/gemini`: (Placeholder) A future agent for Google's Gemini model.
-   `/samples`: Contains scripts for building and running the agent containers for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to provide a flexible and extensible framework for AI-driven software development. By providing a prompt and a target repository, you can have an AI agent clone the repository, perform complex tasks, and automatically submit a pull request with the results.

## Getting Started

1.  Navigate to the directory of the agent you wish to use (e.g., `cd agents/claude`).
2.  Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file within that directory to build and run the agent.
