# Sample Scripts

This directory contains sample scripts to help build and run the coding agents.

## Scripts

### `test_docker_build.sh`

This script builds the Docker image for the Claude agent.

**Usage:**
From the project root directory, run:
```bash
bash samples/test_docker_build.sh
```
This will look for the `Dockerfile` in the `agents/claude` directory and build an image tagged as `claude-code-runner`.

### `test_docker_run.sh`

This script runs the `claude-code-runner` Docker container with a predefined set of environment variables for a sample run.

**Before Running:**
- You may need to update the `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` variables within the script with your own credentials.
- The script uses sample files (`test_prompt.txt`, `test_CLAUDE.md`, etc.) located in this directory to populate the environment variables.

**Usage:**
From the project root directory, run:
```bash
bash samples/test_docker_run.sh
```
This will start the container, which will then execute the task defined in `test_prompt.txt` on the configured test repository.

**Example Output:**
A successful run of this script will result in a new Pull Request being created on the target repository. You can see an example of a PR generated by this agent here:
